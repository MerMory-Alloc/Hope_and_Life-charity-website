# "Hope and Life" Charity Website (Practice Project)

![Charity Logo](public/assets/images/logoG.png)

Welcome to the "Hope and Life" Charity's website repository. This project was created as a practice exercise using Next.js. While the website itself is not associated with the charity, it showcases how such a website could look and function. 

The design for this website was inspired by the work of Odama Studio, which you can find [here](https://dribbble.com/odamastudio). Specifically, it's based on the design available [here](https://dribbble.com/shots/20849261-Pracima-Donation-Landing-Page).

## About This Project

- **Objective:** This project demonstrates the process of building a charity website using Next.js and provides a practical example of how such a website could be structured and designed.

- **Potential Future Use:** If "Hope and Life" Charity grows in the future and requires an official website, the work done here can serve as a foundation and reference point for building the real thing.
